		<br>BAD WRITING/INCOMPLETE,BUT<br> <br>

The story of "abortion" in the United States commences far before the oft assumed era marked by Roe v. Wade.  <br> <br>


In fact, the thirteen colonies assumed the British norm of law when it came to allowing the termination of pregnancies, which were allowed with little controversy until "quickening" – the point about four months along, in which a baby begins to kick. Notably, these terminations were not considered "abortions" at the time – only after quickening would pregnancy termination even merit such a distinction. <br> <br>

During this era, medical perception regarded menstruation cycles as a critical marker of health, where delay or blocked menses should be addressed. Herbal solutions, with active ingredients as widespread as the derivative of a common juniper bush, to this dilemma would typically reintroduce one’s periods, since they effectively ended pregnancies. As such, “abortion” as we think of it today was known in early American history was once known as “restoring the menses."  <br><br>

European settlers weren’t the only ones to follow similar social guidelines in America, nor were they the first – native tribes, too, ended unsafe or unwanted pregnancies, and had been doing so prior to settlers arriving.  <br> <br> 

Once quickening occured, social stance reclassified the blocked menses into human development, placing a moral onus to deliver what was now considered a baby. The same herbal options no longer applied here, although most people eventually respected the option of induced miscarraige, which unofficially recognized the choice for a woman to practice agency over her pregnancy. <br> <br> 


This, of course, did not apply equitably to all women. Those in slavery, unfortunately though unsurprisingly, could only access such resources unthrough the gateway of their owners, who likely would never allow for such an option due to their primary concern of more bodies to perform more labor. <br> <br> 

For nearly a century of America's young independence, pregnancy termination for free women was of course unsafe, given a lack of hospitals and unawareness of hygiene, but it was not illegal. The tide began to turn in the 1860s, when the Catholic/....... THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION COINCIDES W ABOLITIONNNNN JUST SAYING SUS<br> <br>
